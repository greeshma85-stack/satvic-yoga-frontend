                                <p>Satvic Movement is a community-driven health revolution to help you reach the peak of your physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.<br />
                                    The Satvic lifestyle is rooted in principles of simple food, early waking, yoga, loving relationships, service attitude and living in harmony with nature.<br />
                                    The knowledge shared is based on timeless ancient principles and is communicated in modern, practical and easy-to-understand terms.<br />
                                    It is shared through our online workshops (ranging from 3 to 21 days), books and videos.<br />
                                    Founded in 2017, today, Satvic Movement has exploded into a thriving community of thousands of people across India, becoming one of the largest health revolutions in the nation.</p>
